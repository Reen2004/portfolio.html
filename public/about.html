<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Neba Doreen Mawlong, but most people call me Reenâ€”short for Doreen.
  I'm a beginner web designer passionate about creating beautiful, meaningful digital experiences. 
  My love for aesthetics and design led me to pursue web design, and I'm currently expanding my skills through a Udemy bootcamp.</p>

<p>When I'm not designing, you'll likely find me with a crochet hook in hand, lost in the pages of a novel, or out exploring new adventures. 
  I believe creativity comes in many forms, and I love discovering beauty in all its shapes and sizes.</p>

<p>Feel free to [view my work], and if something catches your eye, don't hesitate to email me. Let's create something amazing together!</p>
